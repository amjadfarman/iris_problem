# Classify Iris plants using the dimensions of petals and sepals

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that can classify the iris species using the lengths and widths of sepals and petals.
 The data set is used from the `sklearn` module of Python.
 This data set was originally collected by the biologist and statistician [Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher).

The machine learning model is built using some of the advanced logistic regression technique from `sklearn` module of Python.
